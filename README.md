# Secure Kanban Board

## Description

This simple Kanban board was built to demonstrate authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon successful login, users are authenticated with a JWT, which is temporarily stored in local storage for subsequent authentication requests. Developed as part of the Module 14 Challenge for the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp, this application serves as a practical tool for managing tasksâ€”-organizing them into categories such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." The authentication feature adds an extra layer of security, ensuring user data remains protected. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in connecting a database to Render and integrating it with my deployed application. Additionally, I worked on both the front-end and back-end of a full-stack application, strengthening my development skills and enhancing my marketability for future job opportunities.
